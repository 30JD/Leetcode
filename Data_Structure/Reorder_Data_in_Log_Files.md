# [Leetcode.937 Reorder Data in Log Files](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-data-in-log-files/)

## Question

You have an array of `logs`.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.

For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either:

Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.

Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.

Return the final order of the logs.

### Example 1
```
Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
```

## Constraints

1. `0 <= logs.length <= 100`
2. `3 <= logs[i].length <= 100`
3. `logs[i]` is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.

## Thoughts
** Use `sorted()` to customize the order by specifying `key` **

## Solutions
### Solution.1 Brute force
```python
def reorderLogFiles(self, logs: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        def f(log):
            id_, rest = log.split(" ", 1)
            return (0, rest, id_) if rest[0].isalpha() else (1,)
        return sorted(logs, key = f)
```

## Complex Analysis
* Time Complexity: O(NlogN), because it is how long `sorted()` takes.
* Space Complexity: O(N), we have to store N elements.

## Remark
* Just remember the use of `sorted()`
